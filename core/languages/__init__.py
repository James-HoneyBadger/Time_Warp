"""
Time_Warp Language Support Modules
==================================

This package contains executor classes for all supported programming languages
in the Time_Warp IDE. Each language has its own executor that handles parsing,
execution, and integration with the main interpreter.

Language Executors:
- TwPilotExecutor: Handles TW PILOT commands (T:, A:, J:, Y:, N:, etc.)
- TwBasicExecutor: Handles TW BASIC statements (PRINT, LET, GOTO, etc.)
- TwLogoExecutor: Handles TW Logo commands (FORWARD, RIGHT, REPEAT, etc.)
- TwPascalExecutor: Handles TW Pascal structured programming
- TwPrologExecutor: Handles TW Prolog logic programming
- TwForthExecutor: Handles TW Forth stack-based operations
- PerlExecutor: Handles Perl script execution
- PythonExecutor: Handles Python script execution
- JavaScriptExecutor: Handles JavaScript execution

Each executor follows a consistent interface:
- __init__(interpreter): Initialize with reference to main interpreter
- execute_command(command): Execute a single command and return result

The executors integrate with the Time_WarpInterpreter for shared functionality
like variable management, turtle graphics, and output handling.
