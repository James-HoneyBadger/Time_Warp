# Theme Selector "Coming Soon" Message - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issue:
TimeWarp IDE v1.0.1 displayed a "Theme selection - Coming soon!" message even though the theme selector was fully implemented and working.

## Root Cause:
- Old unused method `show_theme_selector()` contained outdated "coming soon" message
- Method was referenced in Tools menu but never updated after implementing the real theme selector
- Real theme selector is in `View ‚Üí Themes` menu with full functionality

## Solution Applied:
1. **Removed obsolete method:**
   - Deleted `show_theme_selector()` method entirely
   - Method was displaying: `messagebox.showinfo("Theme Selector", "Theme selection - Coming soon!")`

2. **Cleaned up menu references:**
   - Removed `üé® Theme Selector` from Tools menu 
   - Real theme selector remains in `View ‚Üí Themes` with 8 working themes

## Current Status: ‚úÖ FIXED
- No more "coming soon" messages for themes
- Theme selector fully functional with 8 themes:
  - üåô Dark: Dracula, Monokai, Solarized Dark, Ocean  
  - ‚òÄÔ∏è Light: Spring, Sunset, Candy, Forest
- Themes apply instantly and persist between sessions
- All UI components properly themed

## How to Use Theme Selector:
1. Launch TimeWarp IDE v1.0.1
2. Go to `View ‚Üí Themes` in menu bar
3. Select any theme - applies immediately
4. Theme choice saves automatically

The theme selector is now properly integrated and working without any misleading messages! üé®
