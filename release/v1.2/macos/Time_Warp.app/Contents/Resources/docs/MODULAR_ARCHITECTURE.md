- Integration examples

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Design Principles**

### Educational-First Design

- **Progressive Complexity** - Simple languages (PILOT/BASIC) to advanced (Python/JavaScript)
- **Visual Learning** - Integrated turtle graphics for immediate feedback
- **Interactive Exploration** - Real-time code execution and experimentation
- **Comprehensive Examples** - 50+ sample programs across all supported languages

### Professional Engineering

- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between GUI, logic, and data layers
- **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible system without core modifications
- **Modular Development** - Independent components for focused development
- **Testing Integration** - 30+ test modules with comprehensive coverage

### Scalability and Maintenance

- **Component Reusability** - Modules can be imported and used independently
- **Clean Interfaces** - Well-defined APIs between components
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation for users and developers
- **Version Control** - Git integration with development workflow
