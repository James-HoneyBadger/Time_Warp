Time_Warp Modern Language Enhancement Summary
=============================================

This script demonstrates the enhanced modern language integration in Time_Warp IDE,
showcasing the improvements made to Python, JavaScript, and Perl executors.

Enhanced Features:
- Cross-language variable sharing
- Turtle graphics integration
- Package management (pip, npm, cpan)
- Interactive development modes
- Enhanced error handling
- Modern library support

Languages Enhanced:
- Python: Full integration with pip, turtle graphics, variable sharing
- JavaScript: Node.js integration with npm, canvas graphics, ES6+ features
- Perl: CPAN integration, enhanced modules, modern Perl features

TW Languages Maintained:
- PILOT, BASIC, Logo, Prolog: Comprehensive educational implementations preserved
