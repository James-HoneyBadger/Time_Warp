# ðŸŽ‰ CRISIS RESOLUTION SUCCESS - Time_Warp IDE v1.1

## ðŸš¨ ORIGINAL ISSUES REPORTED
The user reported serious issues:
> "we have serious issues. tried running logo_complete_test.logo... brought up a different theme... output displays errors: Malformed REPEAT syntax"

## âœ… ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED

### 1. **Logo REPEAT Parsing Error - FIXED** âœ…
- **Problem**: `logo_complete_test.logo` was failing with "Malformed REPEAT syntax" errors
- **Root Cause**: Multi-line REPEAT blocks like `REPEAT 6 [ FORWARD 60 RIGHT 60 ]` weren't being parsed correctly
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Enhanced `_handle_repeat` method in `core/languages/logo.py`
  - Added `_preprocess_logo_program` method in `core/interpreter.py`
  - Implemented proper multi-line REPEAT block preprocessing
- **Verification**: âœ… `logo_complete_test.logo` now executes successfully with complex turtle graphics
- **Result**: Complete Logo programs with multi-line REPEAT blocks work perfectly

### 2. **Theme Consistency Issue - FIXED** âœ… 
- **Problem**: Loading files caused theme inconsistency (window: `#F5FFFA` vs frames: `#d9d9d9`)
- **Root Cause**: Multiple ThemeManager instances and inconsistent theme application
- **Solution Applied**: Enhanced `apply_theme` method for consistent color application
- **Verification**: âœ… All components now use consistent Forest theme colors
- **Result**: No more gray `#d9d9d9` default colors, all panels match the chosen theme
