---

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY FIXED!**

### 1. **🎨 Code Window Theme Mismatch - RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Code editor background didn't match the Forest theme
**Root Cause:** Problematic theme application code with incorrect tab iteration
**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed theme application in `Time_Warp.py` line ~2757
- Removed incorrect tab iteration that caused errors
- Enhanced `MultiTabEditor.apply_theme()` method in `gui/components/multi_tab_editor.py`
- Added proper error handling for theme application

**✅ Result:** Multi-tab editor now applies theme consistently
```
✅ Multi-tab editor theme applied successfully
```

### 2. **🐢 Logo Turtle Graphics Not Displaying - RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Logo programs executed but graphics didn't appear in GUI
**Root Cause:** Graphics canvas not properly updating after Logo execution
**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced `clear_graphics()` method to handle both enhanced and basic canvas
- Added `update_graphics_display()` method to force graphics refresh
- Added automatic graphics update after successful Logo execution
- Connected turtle graphics system properly to GUI canvas

**✅ Result:** Logo turtle graphics now display correctly
```
🎨 Drawing line from (300.0, 200.0) to (400.0, 200.0)
🎨 Graphics display updated
```

### 3. **📝 File Type Indicator Not Updating - RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Language indicator at bottom didn't update when switching files
**Root Cause:** Language detection method needed better error handling and attribute access
**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced `update_language_indicator()` method in `Time_Warp.py` line ~773
- Added proper exception handling
- Improved file path detection from both `file_path` and `filename` attributes
- Added debug logging for language changes

**✅ Result:** Language indicator now updates properly
```
