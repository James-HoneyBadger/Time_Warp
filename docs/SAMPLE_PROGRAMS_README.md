# TW BASIC Sample Programs

This directory contains sample programs demonstrating the features of the Time Warp IDE's TW BASIC language. These examples are located in the `examples/` directory.

## TW BASIC Samples

### `examples/tw_basic_sample.twb`
A comprehensive demonstration of TW BASIC's unified features:
- **GW BASIC**: Variables, arithmetic, PRINT statements
- **PILOT**: Interactive questions (T:) and answers (A:)
- **Logo**: Turtle graphics commands (FORWARD, RIGHT, etc.)

**Features demonstrated:**
- Variable assignment with LET
- Text output with PRINT
- Interactive input with A: (PILOT style)
- Turtle graphics with FORWARD, RIGHT, etc.
- Logo's REPEAT loop structure

### `examples/tw_basic_game.twb`
A traditional line-numbered BASIC program implementing a number guessing game.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Line-numbered program structure
- Variables and arithmetic
- INPUT for user interaction
- IF...THEN conditional logic
- GOTO for program flow control
- REM comments

## How to Use These Samples

1. **Load a sample program:**
   - Use File → Open File... to load any of the .twb files
   - Or copy/paste the code into the code editor

2. **Run the program:**
   - Click the "Run ▶" button in the toolbar
   - Or use Run → Run Program from the menu
   - The output will appear in the Output & Graphics tab

3. **Interact with the program:**
   - For programs that require input, click in the text area of the Output & Graphics tab
   - Type your response and press Enter
   - Some programs also generate turtle graphics in the graphics area

## TW BASIC Features

- Combines GW BASIC, PILOT, and Logo syntax
- Supports both modern free-form and traditional line-numbered styles
- Use `INPUT` or `A:` for user input
- Logo turtle commands work in any TW BASIC program

## File Extensions
- `.twb` - TW BASIC programs
