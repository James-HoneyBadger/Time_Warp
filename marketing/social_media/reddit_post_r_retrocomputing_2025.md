# TimeWarp IDE: Experience Classic Computing in a Modern Educational Environment

**Retro Computing Meets Modern Development!** üïπÔ∏è Built an IDE that lets you program in authentic 1960s languages (PILOT, BASIC, Logo) while running on contemporary hardware.

## A Love Letter to Computing History

Remember when programming was about **learning fundamental concepts** rather than memorizing framework APIs? TimeWarp IDE brings back that educational focus by preserving three foundational programming languages in a modern, feature-rich development environment.

## The Historical Trio

### **PILOT (1962)** - Computer-Assisted Instruction Pioneer
- **Creator:** John Starkweather, University of California
- **Purpose:** Originally designed for educational software and tutorials
- **Innovation:** Simple command structure perfect for beginners
- **Legacy:** Influenced modern educational programming environments

### **BASIC (1964)** - The People's Programming Language  
- **Creators:** John Kemeny & Thomas Kurtz, Dartmouth College
- **Purpose:** Make programming accessible to non-computer specialists
- **Innovation:** English-like commands, line numbers, immediate mode
- **Legacy:** Launched the personal computer revolution

### **Logo (1967)** - Turtle Graphics and Constructionist Learning
- **Creator:** Seymour Papert and team, MIT
- **Purpose:** Teaching mathematical thinking through programming
- **Innovation:** Visual programming with turtle graphics
- **Legacy:** Influenced modern visual programming languages

## Why This Matters for Retro Computing

### **Software Archaeology in Action**
Most retro computing focuses on preserving hardware and running original binaries. TimeWarp IDE takes a different approach: **preserve the languages themselves** and make them accessible on modern systems.

- **Authentic Syntax:** Write code exactly as it appeared in 1960s documentation
- **Modern Performance:** Native Python execution with full debugging
- **Cross-Platform:** Run your vintage programs on any modern OS
- **Educational Context:** Understand the pedagogical intent behind these languages

### **Living Computer History**
These weren't just programming tools - they were **educational philosophies made manifest**:

- **PILOT** embodied programmed instruction theory
- **BASIC** democratized computing for the masses  
- **Logo** implemented constructionist learning principles

TimeWarp IDE lets you experience these educational philosophies firsthand while benefiting from modern development tools.

## Hands-On Historical Programming

### **Classic BASIC - Just Like 1964:**
```basic
10 PRINT "CREATIVE COMPUTING CHALLENGE"
20 PRINT "GUESS THE SECRET NUMBER!"
30 SECRET = INT(RND(1) * 100) + 1
40 TRIES = 0
50 INPUT "YOUR GUESS"; GUESS
60 TRIES = TRIES + 1
70 IF GUESS = SECRET THEN GOTO 110
80 IF GUESS < SECRET THEN PRINT "TOO LOW!"
90 IF GUESS > SECRET THEN PRINT "TOO HIGH!"
100 GOTO 50
110 PRINT "CORRECT IN"; TRIES; "TRIES!"
120 END
```

### **Logo Turtle Graphics - Mathematical Beauty:**
```logo
TO KOCH_SNOWFLAKE :SIZE :LEVEL
  IF :LEVEL = 0 [
    FORWARD :SIZE
    STOP
  ]
  KOCH_SNOWFLAKE :SIZE / 3 :LEVEL - 1
  LEFT 60
  KOCH_SNOWFLAKE :SIZE / 3 :LEVEL - 1
  RIGHT 120  
  KOCH_SNOWFLAKE :SIZE / 3 :LEVEL - 1
  LEFT 60
  KOCH_SNOWFLAKE :SIZE / 3 :LEVEL - 1
END

REPEAT 3 [
  KOCH_SNOWFLAKE 200 4
  RIGHT 120
]
```

### **PILOT Educational Programming:**
```pilot
