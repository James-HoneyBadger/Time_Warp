Excited to announce the release of TimeWarp IDE v1.0.0 - an educational programming compiler that bridges classic and modern computing!

ðŸŽ“ Educational Impact:
TimeWarp IDE compiles three foundational programming languages from the 1960s (PILOT, BASIC, Logo) into native Linux executables. This unique approach allows students to learn programming fundamentals with time-tested languages while generating modern, distributable software.

ðŸ”§ Technical Innovation:
â€¢ Unified compiler framework with GCC-powered native compilation
â€¢ Zero runtime dependencies - standalone binaries
â€¢ Comprehensive language implementations with arrays, functions, and graphics
â€¢ Open-source architecture for educational and research use

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
- PILOT: Educational language with branching and turtle graphics
- BASIC: Line-numbered programming with full array support
- Logo: Procedural graphics with recursion and variables
- Rich sample programs demonstrating all language features
- Complete documentation and language references

ðŸš€ Perfect for:
â€¢ Computer Science curricula
â€¢ Programming education research
â€¢ Historical computing studies
â€¢ Compiler design education

The project represents a unique intersection of computer history and modern software engineering, making foundational programming concepts accessible through contemporary development practices.
