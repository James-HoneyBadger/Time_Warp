# Time_Warp IDE: Educational Programming Environment with Multi-Language Support

**Show HN:** Built an educational IDE that brings classic programming languages (PILOT, BASIC, Logo) into a modern development environment! üöÄ

## What is Time_Warp IDE?

Time_Warp IDE is a comprehensive educational programming environment designed for learning fundamental programming concepts. It supports 6 programming languages including three foundational educational languages from the 1960s alongside modern ones, all in a unified tkinter-based IDE.

## Supported Languages

### **Classic Educational Languages:**
- **PILOT (1962)** - Educational language with turtle graphics and branching logic
- **BASIC (1964)** - Line-numbered programming with arrays and control structures  
- **Logo (1967)** - Turtle graphics programming with procedures and recursion

### **Modern Languages:**
- **Python** - Full Python 3 support with built-in execution
- **JavaScript** - Client-side scripting capabilities
- **Perl** - Text processing and scripting

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Unified IDE** - Single environment for multiple languages  
‚úÖ **Turtle Graphics** - Built-in canvas for Logo and PILOT graphics  
‚úÖ **Educational Focus** - Perfect for computer science teaching  
‚úÖ **Theme System** - 8 built-in themes (4 dark, 4 light)  
‚úÖ **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible with custom functionality  
‚úÖ **Open Source** - MIT licensed, contributions welcome  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform** - Runs on Linux, Windows, macOS  

## Why This Matters

Most programming education today jumps straight to modern languages without understanding the foundational concepts. Time_Warp IDE lets students and educators explore the evolution of programming languages while working in a modern, feature-rich environment.

## Quick Demo

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/James-HoneyBadger/Time_Warp.git
cd Time_Warp
python Time_Warp.py

# Or with auto-environment setup
./start_timewarp.sh
```

## Sample Programs Showcase

**BASIC with Arrays:**
```basic
10 DIM SCORES(10)
20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
30   SCORES(I) = I * 15 + RND(20)
40 NEXT I
50 PRINT "Game Scores:"
60 FOR I = 1 TO 10
70   PRINT "Player "; I; ": "; SCORES(I)
80 NEXT I
90 END
```

**Logo Recursive Graphics:**
```logo
TO FRACTAL_TREE :SIZE :DEPTH
  IF :DEPTH = 0 [STOP]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  LEFT 30
  FRACTAL_TREE :SIZE * 0.7 :DEPTH - 1
  RIGHT 60
  FRACTAL_TREE :SIZE * 0.7 :DEPTH - 1
  LEFT 30
  BACK :SIZE
END

FRACTAL_TREE 100 5
```

**PILOT Interactive Quiz:**
```pilot
R: Programming Quiz System

*START
T: What year was BASIC created?
A: Your answer
C: #CORRECT = 1964
J: (#ANS = #CORRECT) *RIGHT
T: Try again! BASIC was created in the 1960s.
J: *START

*RIGHT
T: Correct! BASIC was created in 1964 at Dartmouth.
T: Quiz complete!
E:
```

## Technical Architecture

### **Multi-Language Interpreter System:**
- **Central Time_WarpInterpreter** - Unified execution engine
