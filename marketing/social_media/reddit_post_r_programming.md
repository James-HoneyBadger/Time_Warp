# Time_Warp IDE v1.0.0: Compile 1960s Educational Languages to Native Executables

**Show HN:** Just released Time_Warp IDE - a compiler that transforms classic educational programming languages into modern native binaries!

## What is Time_Warp IDE?

Time_Warp IDE is an educational programming compiler that takes three foundational languages from the 1960s and compiles them to standalone Linux executables. No interpreters required - just native performance with GCC compilation.

## Supported Languages

- **PILOT** - Educational language with turtle graphics and branching
- **BASIC** - Classic line-numbered programming with arrays and functions
- **Logo** - Educational turtle graphics with procedures and recursion

## Key Features

✅ **Native Compilation** - GCC-powered executable generation
✅ **Zero Dependencies** - Standalone binaries that run anywhere
✅ **Educational Focus** - Perfect for computer science teaching
✅ **Rich Examples** - Comprehensive sample programs for all languages
✅ **Open Source** - MIT licensed, contributions welcome

## Why This Matters

Most educational programming tools today use interpreted languages or web-based environments. Time_Warp IDE bridges the gap by letting students and educators work with time-tested languages while generating modern, distributable executables.

## Quick Demo

```bash
# Install
pip install time_warp-ide

# Compile a BASIC program
time_warp-compiler hello.bas -o hello

# Run the native executable
./hello
```

## Sample Programs Included

**BASIC Arrays:**

```basic
10 DIM SCORES(10)
20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
30 SCORES(I) = I * 10
40 NEXT I
50 PRINT "Scores:"
60 FOR I = 1 TO 10
70 PRINT "Score"; I; ": "; SCORES(I)
80 NEXT I
90 END
```

**Logo Graphics:**

```logo
TO TREE :SIZE
  IF :SIZE < 5 [STOP]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT 25
  TREE :SIZE * 0.7
  LEFT 50
  TREE :SIZE * 0.7
  RIGHT 25
  BACK :SIZE
END

TREE 100
```

**PILOT Quiz:**

```pilot
R: Math Quiz

*START
T: What is 5 + 3?
A: Your answer
C: #CORRECT = 8
J: (#ANS = #CORRECT) *CORRECT
T: Sorry, 5 + 3 = 8
J: *END

*CORRECT
T: Correct! Well done!

*END
T: Quiz complete!
E:
```

## Technical Architecture

- **Unified Compiler Framework** - BaseCompiler with language-specific implementations
- **C Code Generation** - Optimized intermediate representation
- **Runtime Libraries** - Language-specific C libraries for I/O, math, and graphics
