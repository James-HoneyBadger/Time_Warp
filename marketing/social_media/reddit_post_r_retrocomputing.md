# TimeWarp IDE: Modern Compiler for 1960s Educational Languages

**Bringing PILOT, BASIC, and Logo into the 21st Century!** 🕹️

## A Bridge Between Computing Eras

Remember the early days of educational computing? TimeWarp IDE lets you compile programs written in three foundational languages from the 1960s into modern native executables. No emulators or interpreters required - just GCC-powered compilation that runs on contemporary Linux systems.

## The Classic Trio

### **PILOT (1962)** - The Original Educational Language
Designed by John Starkweather at the University of California, PILOT was created specifically for computer-assisted instruction. Its simple branching and text-based interaction made it perfect for early educational software.

### **BASIC (1964)** - The People's Programming Language
Created by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth, BASIC democratized programming by making it accessible to non-specialists. TimeWarp supports line-numbered BASIC with arrays, loops, and string operations.

### **Logo (1967)** - Turtle Graphics Pioneer
Developed by Seymour Papert and colleagues at MIT, Logo introduced the concept of turtle graphics that made programming visual and intuitive. Draw complex shapes and fractals with procedures and recursion.

## Why This Matters for Retro Computing

Most retro computing enthusiasts focus on preserving hardware and running original software in emulators. TimeWarp IDE takes a different approach: **it preserves the languages while modernizing the execution environment**.

### **Preservation Through Innovation**
- **Authentic Syntax:** Write code exactly as it would have been in the 1960s
- **Modern Performance:** GCC optimization and native execution
- **Cross-Platform:** Run your classic programs on contemporary hardware
- **No Dependencies:** Standalone executables that don't require vintage hardware

### **Educational Computing Revival**
These languages weren't just programming tools - they were designed to teach fundamental computing concepts. TimeWarp IDE lets you experience the original educational intent while benefiting from modern computing power.

## Hands-On Examples

**Classic BASIC Array Program:**
```basic
10 DIM SCORES(10)
20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
30   SCORES(I) = I * 10
40 NEXT I
50 PRINT "SCORES:"
60 FOR I = 1 TO 10
70   PRINT "PLAYER"; I; ": "; SCORES(I)
80 NEXT I
90 END
```

**Logo Turtle Graphics:**
```logo
TO SPIRAL :SIZE :ANGLE
  IF :SIZE > 200 [STOP]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT :ANGLE
  SPIRAL :SIZE + 5 :ANGLE
END

SPIRAL 10 45
```

**PILOT Interactive Program:**
```pilot
R: ADVENTURE GAME

*START
T: You are in a dark cave.
T: Do you go NORTH or SOUTH?

A: Your choice
J: (*ANS = NORTH) *NORTH
J: (*ANS = SOUTH) *SOUTH
T: Please choose NORTH or SOUTH
J: *START

*NORTH
T: You find treasure! Adventure complete.
E:

*SOUTH
T: You encounter a dragon! Game over.
E:
```

## Technical Implementation

TimeWarp IDE uses a sophisticated compilation pipeline:
1. **Parse** the vintage syntax into an abstract syntax tree
2. **Generate optimized C code** with custom runtime libraries
3. **Compile to native binaries** using GCC
4. **Link with language-specific libraries** for I/O, math, and graphics

The result? Programs that run faster and more reliably than they would have on the original hardware, while maintaining complete fidelity to the original language specifications.

## Perfect for Retro Computing Projects

### **Software Archaeology**
- Recover and run programs from old magazines, books, and archives
- Test implementations against historical documentation
- Compare performance across computing generations

### **Educational Preservation**
- Experience the original intent of educational programming
- Understand how programming education has evolved
- Teach computing history through hands-on programming

### **Modern Applications**
- Generate graphics and data for contemporary projects
- Create standalone executables for distribution
- Interface classic algorithms with modern systems

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install the modern way
pip install timewarp-ide

# Compile your vintage code
timewarp-compiler program.bas -o program
timewarp-compiler drawing.logo -o drawing
timewarp-compiler quiz.pilot -o quiz

# Run natively on modern hardware
./program
./drawing  # Outputs PPM graphics
./quiz
```
