Title: Show HN: Time_Warp IDE - Compile 1960s Educational Languages to Native Executables

Text:
Time_Warp IDE compiles three classic educational programming languages (PILOT, BASIC, Logo) from the 1960s into modern native Linux executables using GCC. No interpreters or emulators - generates standalone binaries with zero runtime dependencies.

Why it matters:
• Educational languages designed for teaching (not just programming)
• Native performance vs interpreted execution
• Preserves classic syntax while enabling modern distribution
• Perfect for computer science education and retro computing

Quick demo:
pip install time_warp-ide
time_warp-compiler hello.bas -o hello && ./hello

The compiler generates optimized C code with custom runtime libraries for each language. PILOT handles branching and text interaction, BASIC supports arrays and line-numbered programming, Logo creates turtle graphics output.

Open source, MIT licensed. Built in Python with comprehensive documentation and sample programs.
