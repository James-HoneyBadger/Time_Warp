# Time_Warp IDE: Multi-Language Educational Programming Environment - Learn coding through 1960s classics (PILOT, BASIC, Logo) to modern Python!

**Cool Project Alert!** 🚀 Built a unique IDE that lets you experience programming language evolution firsthand - from 1960s educational languages to modern development!

## What Makes This Project Cool?

Time_Warp IDE isn't just another code editor - it's a **time machine for programming languages**! Experience how programming education evolved by coding in the same languages that taught the first generation of programmers, all within a modern, polished IDE.

### **🕰️ Time Travel Through Programming History**
- **PILOT (1962)** - The original educational programming language
- **BASIC (1964)** - The language that democratized computing  
- **Logo (1967)** - Revolutionary turtle graphics programming
- **Plus modern Python, JavaScript, and Perl**

### **🎨 Visual Programming Magic**
Watch your code come to life with built-in turtle graphics! Logo and PILOT programs create beautiful visual art while teaching programming fundamentals.

```logo
TO SPIRAL_ART :SIZE :ANGLE :COUNT
  IF :COUNT = 0 [STOP]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT :ANGLE
  SPIRAL_ART :SIZE + 3 :ANGLE + 1 :COUNT - 1
END

## 🤯 Mind-Blowing Code Examples

### **Interactive PILOT Adventure Game:**
```pilot
R: Escape the Digital Maze!

*START
T: You're trapped in a computer system from 1962!
T: There are TWO exits: PORTAL or GATEWAY
A: Choose your escape route

J: (*ANS = PORTAL) *PORTAL_PATH
J: (*ANS = GATEWAY) *GATEWAY_PATH
T: Type PORTAL or GATEWAY to escape!
J: *START

*PORTAL_PATH
T: The portal glows with retro green text...
T: You've escaped to the modern era! 
T: 🎉 SUCCESS! You understand vintage computing!
E:

*GATEWAY_PATH
T: The gateway shows punch cards and magnetic tape...
T: You've discovered the heart of early computing!
T: 💾 ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Computing Historian!
E:
```

### **BASIC Array Magic:**
```basic
10 PRINT "🎯 RANDOM PATTERN GENERATOR"
20 DIM PATTERN(20, 20)
30 FOR ROW = 1 TO 20
40   FOR COL = 1 TO 20
50     PATTERN(ROW, COL) = INT(RND(1) * 4)
60     IF PATTERN(ROW, COL) = 0 THEN PRINT "⬛";
70     IF PATTERN(ROW, COL) = 1 THEN PRINT "⬜";
80     IF PATTERN(ROW, COL) = 2 THEN PRINT "🟦";
90     IF PATTERN(ROW, COL) = 3 THEN PRINT "🟨";
100   NEXT COL
110   PRINT
120 NEXT ROW
130 END
```

### **Logo Fractal Art:**
```logo
TO DRAGON_CURVE :SIZE :LEVEL :DIRECTION
  IF :LEVEL = 0 [
    FORWARD :SIZE
    STOP
  ]
  DRAGON_CURVE :SIZE :LEVEL - 1 1
  RIGHT :DIRECTION * 90
  DRAGON_CURVE :SIZE :LEVEL - 1 -1
END

DRAGON_CURVE 5 10 1  # Creates the famous Dragon Curve fractal!
```
