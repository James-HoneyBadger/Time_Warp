## The Problem

Most programming education today uses interpreted languages or web-based environments. While these are accessible, they often hide the realities of software compilation and distribution. What if students could learn with proven educational languages while understanding native executable generation?

## The Solution: TimeWarp IDE

TimeWarp IDE is an educational programming compiler that takes three foundational languages from the 1960s and compiles them to standalone Linux executables. No interpreters required - just GCC-powered native performance.

## Supported Languages

### PILOT (1962)
An educational language designed for computer-assisted instruction:

```pilot
R: Math Quiz Program

*START
T: Welcome to the Math Quiz!
T: What is 5 + 3?

A: Your answer
C: #CORRECT = 8
J: (#ANS = #CORRECT) *CORRECT
T: Sorry, 5 + 3 = 8. Try again!
J: *START

*CORRECT
T: Excellent! 5 + 3 = 8
T: Quiz complete!
E:
```

### BASIC (1964)
Classic line-numbered programming with modern enhancements:

```basic
10 REM Array demonstration
20 DIM SCORES(10)
30 FOR I = 1 TO 10
40   SCORES(I) = I * 10
50 NEXT I
60 PRINT "Score Table:"
70 FOR I = 1 TO 10
80   PRINT "Player"; I; ": "; SCORES(I)
90 NEXT I
100 END
```

### Logo (1967)
Turtle graphics with procedures and recursion:

```logo
TO SQUARE :SIZE
  REPEAT 4 [FORWARD :SIZE RIGHT 90]
END

TO TREE :SIZE
  IF :SIZE < 5 [STOP]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT 25
  TREE :SIZE * 0.7
  LEFT 50
  TREE :SIZE * 0.7
  RIGHT 25
  BACK :SIZE
END

SQUARE 100
TREE 80
```

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install timewarp-ide

# Compile programs
timewarp-compiler hello.bas -o hello
timewarp-compiler drawing.logo -o logo_app
timewarp-compiler quiz.pilot -o math_quiz

# Run native executables
./hello
./logo_app  # Generates PPM graphics file
./math_quiz
```

## Technical Architecture

### Compilation Pipeline

1. **Source Parsing** - Language-specific syntax analysis
2. **C Code Generation** - Convert to optimized C with runtime libraries
3. **GCC Compilation** - Native binary generation with optimizations
4. **Standalone Executable** - Zero external dependencies

### Compiler Framework

```python
class BaseCompiler:
    def compile_source(self, source_code: str) -> CompilerResult:
        """Unified compilation interface"""

class BasicCompiler(BaseCompiler):
    def parse_source(self, source: str) -> List[Statement]:
        # BASIC-specific parsing logic

    def generate_c_code(self, statements: List[Statement]) -> str:
        # Generate optimized C code
```

### Runtime Libraries

Each language includes specialized C runtime libraries:
- **String manipulation** and I/O operations
- **Mathematical functions** and array handling
- **Turtle graphics** rendering (PPM format for Logo)
- **Variable management** and scope resolution

## Educational Value

### Why Classic Languages Matter

These languages were designed specifically for education:
- **PILOT**: Focuses on instructional sequencing and branching
- **BASIC**: Teaches structured programming fundamentals
- **Logo**: Introduces procedural thinking and graphics

### Modern Benefits

- **Native Performance**: GCC optimization and no interpreter overhead
- **Software Distribution**: Students learn about executable creation
- **Cross-Platform**: Architecture supports Windows/macOS expansion
- **Open Source**: Study real compiler implementation

## Sample Programs Showcase

The release includes comprehensive examples:

**BASIC Functions:**
```basic
10 DEF FNSQUARE(X) = X * X
20 PRINT "Square of 5:"; FNSQUARE(5)
30 PRINT "Square of 10:"; FNSQUARE(10)
40 END
```

**Logo Complex Graphics:**
```logo
TO SPIRAL :SIZE :ANGLE
  IF :SIZE > 200 [STOP]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT :ANGLE
  SPIRAL :SIZE + 5 :ANGLE
END

SPIRAL 10 45
```

**PILOT Interactive Story:**
```pilot
R: Choose Your Own Adventure

*BEGIN
T: You find yourself in a dark forest.
T: Do you go LEFT or RIGHT?

A: Your choice
J: (*ANS = LEFT) *LEFT_PATH
J: (*ANS = RIGHT) *RIGHT_PATH
T: Please choose LEFT or RIGHT
J: *BEGIN

*LEFT_PATH
T: You find treasure! Congratulations!
E:

*RIGHT_PATH
T: You encounter a dragon! Game Over!
E:
```

## Future Roadmap

- **Platform Expansion**: Windows and macOS executable support
- **Additional Languages**: Pascal, FORTRAN, and other educational languages
- **Web Integration**: Browser-based IDE with compilation
- **Performance**: Further optimization and language features
- **Community**: Educational partnerships and contributions

## Getting Started
