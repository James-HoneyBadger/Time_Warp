2. Set your network range (default: 192.168.1.0/24)
3. Click "üîç Scan Network" or "üîÑ Auto-Discover"
4. Select discovered devices and add them to managed devices

### Device Control
1. Go to the "üéõÔ∏è Device Control" tab
2. Select a device from the connected devices list
3. Use control buttons to interact with devices
4. Monitor device status and send custom commands

### Network Monitoring
1. Switch to the "üåê Network Monitor" tab
2. View real-time network statistics
3. Monitor traffic logs and patterns
4. Start/stop monitoring as needed

### Protocol Configuration
1. Access the "üì° Protocols" tab
2. View supported IoT protocols and their status
3. Configure, enable, or disable protocols
4. Test protocol connections

### Analytics

4. Configure monitoring alerts

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Plugin Type**: Tool Plugin
- **Base Class**: ToolPlugin
- **Category**: IoT
- **UI Framework**: Tkinter with TTK

### Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- tkinter (included with Python)
- JAMES Core Framework

### Events
The plugin emits various events for integration with the JAMES framework:
- `network_scan_completed`
- `device_discovered`
- `device_added`
- `iot_device_controlled`
- `protocol_configured`
- `analytics_refreshed`

### Sample Data
The plugin includes sample IoT devices and data for demonstration:
- Smart lights and bulbs
- Thermostats and climate control
- Security cameras
- Environmental sensors
- Smart plugs and switches

## Configuration

The plugin maintains configuration in the IoT state object:
```python
iot_state = {
    'discovered_devices': [],
    'managed_devices': [],
    'protocols': {},
    'network_traffic': [],
    'analytics_data': {}
}
```

## Development

### Adding New Protocols
1. Update the `_populate_protocols()` method
2. Add protocol-specific handling in device control methods
3. Update the discovery logic for new protocol support

### Extending Device Types
1. Add new device types to sample data
2. Implement device-specific control methods
3. Update the analytics charts for new device categories

### Custom Events
The plugin supports custom event emission:
```python
self.emit_event('custom_event_name', event_data)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No devices discovered**: Check network connectivity and range settings
- **Protocol errors**: Verify protocol is enabled and configured correctly
- **UI not responsive**: Ensure proper initialization of UI components

### Debug Mode
Enable debug output by setting the plugin logging level to debug.

## Future Enhancements

- Real hardware integration with actual IoT devices
- Cloud service connectivity
- Advanced security features
- Machine learning analytics
- Mobile app integration
- Voice control interface
