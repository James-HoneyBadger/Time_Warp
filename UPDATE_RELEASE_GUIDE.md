# How to Update Time_Warp IDE v1.1 Release

## üéØ Update Options

### Option 1: Update Existing v1.1 Release (Recommended)

Since we've made critical execution fixes, we should update the existing v1.1 release:

#### Step 1: Prepare Updated Release Assets
```bash
cd /home/james/Time_Warp

# Run release preparation script to create new assets
./scripts/prepare_release.sh

# This will update:
# - release/v1.1/Time_Warp-IDE-v1.1.tar.gz (with execution fixes)
# - release/v1.1/VERSION_INFO.txt (updated)
# - release/v1.1/SHA256SUMS.txt (new checksums)
# - release/v1.1/install.sh (same)
```

#### Step 2: Update GitHub Release
1. **Go to GitHub Release**: https://github.com/James-HoneyBadger/Time_Warp/releases/tag/v1.1
2. **Click "Edit release"**
3. **Update Release Notes** (add execution fixes section):

```markdown

   - Update `VERSION_INFO.txt` if changed
   - Update `SHA256SUMS.txt` with new checksums

5. **Save Release**

### Option 2: Create v1.1.1 Patch Release

If you prefer to create a patch release:

#### Step 1: Create v1.1.1 Tag
```bash
cd /home/james/Time_Warp

# Create patch version
git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Time_Warp IDE v1.1.1 - Critical Execution Fixes

üîß Critical Fixes:
- Fixed program execution issues across all languages
- Resolved GUI output display problems
- Verified all language commands and I/O functionality
- Enhanced testing and reliability

All languages now work correctly: BASIC, PILOT, Logo, Python, JavaScript, Perl"

# Push tag
git push origin v1.1.1
```

#### Step 2: Update Release Script for v1.1.1
```bash
# Modify scripts/prepare_release.sh
# Change VERSION="1.1" to VERSION="1.1.1"
sed -i 's/VERSION="1.1"/VERSION="1.1.1"/' scripts/prepare_release.sh

# Run preparation
./scripts/prepare_release.sh
```

#### Step 3: Create GitHub Release
- Go to: https://github.com/James-HoneyBadger/Time_Warp/releases/new
- Select tag: v1.1.1
- Title: "Time_Warp IDE v1.1.1 - Critical Execution Fixes"
- Upload new assets from `release/v1.1.1/`

### Option 3: Create v1.2 Minor Release

For a more significant update:

```bash
# Update version to 1.2
sed -i 's/VERSION="1.1"/VERSION="1.2"/' scripts/prepare_release.sh

# Create tag
git tag -a v1.2 -m "Time_Warp IDE v1.2 - Enhanced Execution and Verification"

# Run preparation and create release
```

## üéØ **Recommended Approach: Update v1.1**

Since the execution fixes are critical bug fixes for v1.1, I recommend **Option 1** (updating the existing v1.1 release):

### Why Update v1.1:
- ‚úÖ Fixes critical functionality that should have worked in v1.1
- ‚úÖ Maintains version consistency 
- ‚úÖ Users who downloaded v1.1 will see the update
- ‚úÖ No confusion about multiple patch versions

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Regenerate Release Assets**:
```bash
cd /home/james/Time_Warp
./scripts/prepare_release.sh
```

2. **Update GitHub Release**:
   - Edit existing v1.1 release
   - Add "UPDATED" section to release notes
   - Replace release assets with fixed versions
   - Emphasize that execution issues are now resolved

3. **Announce Update**:
   - Update r/SideProject post if needed
   - Mention in README that v1.1 has been updated with fixes
   - Consider GitHub discussion post about the fixes

## üöÄ **Expected Impact**

After updating v1.1:
- ‚úÖ All users get working program execution
- ‚úÖ Educational deployment can proceed confidently  
- ‚úÖ Community trust maintained with quick bug fixes
- ‚úÖ Time_Warp IDE reputation as reliable educational tool

Would you like me to help implement the update using Option 1 (updating v1.1)?
