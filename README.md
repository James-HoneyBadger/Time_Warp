## üíª Programming Languages

### PILOT Language
Educational programming language designed for interactive learning:

```pilot
T: Welcome to PILOT programming!
T: What is your name?
A: #NAME
T: Hello, #NAME! Let's do some math.
T: What is 5 + 3?
A: #ANSWER
M: #ANSWER = 8
J: *CORRECT
T: Try again!
J: *END

*CORRECT
T: Excellent! You got it right.

*END
T: Thanks for trying PILOT!
```

### BASIC Language
Classic programming with line numbers and structured flow:

```basic
10 PRINT "Welcome to BASIC programming!"
20 INPUT "Enter your name: "; NAME$
30 PRINT "Hello, "; NAME$
40 FOR I = 1 TO 5
50   PRINT "Counting: "; I
60 NEXT I
70 PRINT "Program complete!"
80 END
```

### Logo Language  
Turtle graphics programming with procedures:

```logo
TO SQUARE :SIZE
  REPEAT 4 [FORWARD :SIZE RIGHT 90]
END

TO FLOWER
  REPEAT 8 [
    SQUARE 50
    RIGHT 45
  ]
END

CLEARSCREEN
FLOWER
```

### Python Integration
Full Python language support with Time_Warp IDE integration:

```python
import math
import random

# Time_Warp IDE provides turtle graphics
print("Python in Time_Warp IDE!")

# Generate random numbers
for i in range(5):
    num = random.randint(1, 100)
    sqrt_num = math.sqrt(num)
    print(f"‚àö{num} = {sqrt_num:.2f}")
```

### JavaScript Support
Modern JavaScript execution with console output:

```javascript
console.log("JavaScript in Time_Warp IDE!");

// Array manipulation
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squared = numbers.map(n => n * n);
console.log("Original:", numbers);
console.log("Squared:", squared);

// Object-oriented programming
class Student {
    constructor(name, grade) {
        this.name = name;
        this.grade = grade;
    }
    
    introduce() {
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} in grade ${this.grade}`);
    }
}

const student = new Student("Alice", 10);
student.introduce();
```

### Perl Language
Text processing and system scripting:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Perl in Time_Warp IDE!\n";

# Text processing example
my $text = "Hello, World!";
$text =~ s/World/Time_Warp/;
print "$text\n";

# Array operations
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
my @doubled = map { $_ * 2 } @numbers;
print "Doubled: " . join(", ", @doubled) . "\n";
```
