## Time Warp Language Features

### Unified Syntax
Time Warp combines three educational programming paradigms:

1. **PILOT (Programmed Inquiry, Learning Or Teaching)**
   - `T:` - Text output
   - `A:` - Accept input
   - `J:` - Jump to labels
   - `Y:`/`N:` - Conditional branching

2. **BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)**
   - `LET` - Variable assignment
   - `PRINT` - Text output
   - `IF...THEN` - Conditional execution
   - `WHILE...END WHILE` - Loop structures

3. **Logo (Turtle Graphics)**
   - `FORWARD`/`BACK` - Movement
   - `RIGHT`/`LEFT` - Turning
   - `PENUP`/`PENDOWN` - Drawing control
   - `REPEAT [...]` - Loop blocks

### Modern Enhancements
- Variable interpolation with `*VARIABLE*` syntax
- Mathematical functions (`SIN`, `COS`, `SQRT`, etc.)
- String operations (`LEN`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`)
- Array operations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Random number generation (`RND`)

## Running the Examples

1. Launch Time_Warp IDE
2. Select "‚è∞ Time Warp" from the Language menu
3. Open any `.tw` file from this directory
4. Click "‚ñ∂ Run Program" to execute

## Educational Value

These examples demonstrate how Time Warp serves as a bridge between different programming paradigms, making it easier for students to:

- Understand fundamental programming concepts
- Transition between different programming styles
- Create engaging visual programs
- Learn mathematical concepts through graphics
- Develop interactive educational content
