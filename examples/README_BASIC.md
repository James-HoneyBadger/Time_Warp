# TimeWarp IDE - Comprehensive BASIC Examples

This directory contains comprehensive BASIC programming examples that demonstrate
various commands, features, and programming concepts in the BASIC language.

## BASIC Language Overview

BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of general-purpose,
high-level programming languages designed for ease of use. TimeWarp IDE implements
a classic BASIC with line numbers and simple syntax.

Key features:

- Line numbers for program structure
- Simple variable naming (A-Z, A0-Z9)
- Built-in functions and commands
- GOTO for control flow
- PRINT for output
- INPUT for user interaction
