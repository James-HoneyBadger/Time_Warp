# TimeWarp IDE - Comprehensive PILOT Examples

This directory contains comprehensive PILOT (Programmed Inquiry, Learning Or Teaching)
programming examples that demonstrate various commands, features, and programming
concepts in the PILOT language.

## PILOT Language Overview

PILOT is an educational programming language designed for interactive learning and
teaching. It emphasizes structured programming with commands for:
- Text output (T:)
- User input (A:)
- Computations (C:)
- Jumps and control flow (J:, Y:, N:)
- Comments (R:)
